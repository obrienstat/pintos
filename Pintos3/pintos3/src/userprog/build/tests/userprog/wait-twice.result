FAIL
Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:
  (test) begin
  (child-simple) run
  child-simple: exit(81)
  (test) wait(exec()) = 81
  (test) wait(exec()) = -1
  (test) end
  wait-twice: exit(0)
Differences in `diff -u' format:
  (test) begin
- (child-simple) run
- child-simple: exit(81)
- (test) wait(exec()) = 81
- (test) wait(exec()) = -1
- (test) end
+ system call!
  wait-twice: exit(0)
