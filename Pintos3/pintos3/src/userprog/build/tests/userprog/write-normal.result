FAIL
Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:
  (test) begin
  (test) create "test.txt"
  (test) open "test.txt"
  (test) end
  write-normal: exit(0)
Differences in `diff -u' format:
  (test) begin
  (test) create "test.txt"
- (test) open "test.txt"
- (test) end
+ system call!
  write-normal: exit(0)
